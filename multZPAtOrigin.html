    <title>Multiple Zeros Or Poles At Origin</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    If a system has multiple poles or zeros at the origin, components of the phase plot may appear to disagree.
    This is because the phase of a complex number is
    not unique; the phase of -1 could be +180 degrees
    or -180 or +/-540...  Likewise the phase of 1/s^2
    could be +180 degrees, or -180 degrees (or +/-540
    Keep this in mind when looking at the phase plots.
