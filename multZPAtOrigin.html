    <h1>Multiple Zeros Or Poles At Origin</h1>
    <p>If a system has multiple poles or zeros at the origin, components of the phase plot may appear to disagree.</p>
    <p>This is because the phase of a complex number is
    not unique; the phase of -1 could be +180 degrees
    or -180 or +/-540...</p>  
    <p>Likewise the phase of 1/s^2 could be +180 degrees, or -180 degrees or +/-540...</p>
    <p>Keep this in mind when looking at the phase plots.</p>
