    <h1>Positive Real Zeros</h1>
    <p>For a nonminimum phase system (zeros in right half plane), the standard rules for phase do not apply.</p>
    <p>Also - The plots produced may be different than the Matlab Bode plot by a factor of 360 degrees. </p>  
    <p>So though the graphs don't look the same, they are equivalent.</p>
    <p>Keep this in mind when looking at the phase plots.</p>
